# GxE-pipeline

This repo contains scripts that comprise the Gene by Environment Interaction (GxE) pipeline, for alignment & statistical modeling of allelic imbalances in RNA-Seq data across many cellular environments.

1. Align RNA-seq reads and perform QC
2. Create pileups & run the QuASAR (EM) pipeline to infer ASE
3. Process QuASAR output and prepare for MESH 
4. Run MESH (MCMC) in parallel, & calculate Bayes Factors & posteriors
5. Process MESH output in preparation for multiclass logistic regression
     	  	   	   		     
## 1. Read alignment, quality filtering, & QC  
### Fastq -> bam 
For a new experiment, these scripts create the directory structure for read mapping and quality control of RNA-Seq reads.
