# GxE-pipeline
This repo contains scripts that comprise the Gene Environment Interaction (GxE) pipeline, for alignment & statistical modeling of allelic imbalances in RNA-Seq data across many cellular environments.

## Outline
### I. Align RNA-seq reads and perform QC
  * 1.) Create directories, symbolic link to fastqs, and distribute scripts for alignment
  * 2.) Align reads, merge barcodes, and perform QC
  * 3.) Read counts from all stages of filtering
  * 4.) Gene counts using DESeq2
  * 5.) Make pileups for QuASAR

### II. QuASAR (EM) pipeline to infer individual ASE
  * 6.) Create directories, symbolic link to pileups, and distribute scripts for QuASAR
  * 7.) Run the QuASAR pipeline for joint genotyping and inference   
  * 8.) Add gene annotations to QuASAR output

### III. Process QuASAR output and prepare for MESH 
  * 9.) Combine all QuASAR output into a master table
  * 10.) Add logFC annotations (Greg's script)
  * 11.) Create directories and distribute scripts for MESH	
  * 12.) Split data for MESH and distribute to analysis directory

### IV. MESH (MCMC) to infer condition specific ASE
  * 13.) Run the MESH pipeline
  * 14.) Calculate posteriors and bayes factors
  * 15.) Plot condition specific ASE
  * 16.) Prep data for Multinomial

### V. Process MESH output in preparation for multiclass logistic regression
  * 17.) Run multiclass logistic regression
  * 18.) Plot regression results

## Notes
  * Label the top directory as: td=/wsu/home/groups/piquelab/charvey/GxE
  * Scripts that call other scripts are chained together using ->
  * I is performed per plate, so we will use DP1 as an example. All other plates can be processed similarly by replacing DP1 with the desired plate.
